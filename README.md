### How to run the app

Install json-server globally

```sh
$ yarn global add json-server
```

Then run the following for iOS or Android

```sh
$ yarn run start:ios
$ yarn run start:android
```

The above commands will concurrently run react-native and the mock backend service which is the json-server
